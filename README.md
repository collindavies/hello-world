I think data is powerful. 
I've used data to plan roadtrips, track my running and cycling performance, and choose a restaurant for dinner. 
As a scientist, I've used data to develop and describe new technologies to turn dirty water into safe, drinking water.
I'm constantly learning new tools to more efficiently compile, analyze, and manage datasets.
